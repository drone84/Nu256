The simulator loads the kernel ROM from a hex file. The ROM is a separate build and is located in \Nu64\Kernel. 

1. You must assemble the kernel in the Kernel directory. 
   * run assemble.bat. 
   * confirm that assembly completed successfully.
2. The Vsual Studio project should already have a build step to copy kernel.hex into the ROMs directory. 
   If not, copy kernel.hex into \Nu64\Nu64 Simulator\ROMs
3. Build the project with Visual Studio. The Windows executable should compile, and kernel.hex will be
   copied to the output. 

At that point, you should be able to run the program. If you need to update the kernel ROM, you can assemble it separately.
